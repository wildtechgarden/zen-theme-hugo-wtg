# Acknowledgements

## Thank you

* '@davidsneighbour' for introducing me to [pre-commit][precommit] and whose
configurations I have gleefully extended (for example adding
[CSpell][cspell] for spell checking).

## Credits

This is a highly modified fork of the [Hugo theme Zen](https://github.com/frjo/hugo-theme-zen by [Frederik Jonsson](https://github.com/frjo/hugo-theme-zen/commits?author=frjo).

### Original credits follow

This is originally a port of the [Zen](https://www.drupal.org/project/zen) theme by [JohnAlbin](https://www.drupal.org/u/johnalbin), a very popular base theme for Drupal.

Thanks to the [Cupper Hugo theme](https://github.com/zwbetz-gh/cupper-hugo-theme/) for a really good Readme, have copied a lot from it.

Icons from [tabler/tabler-icons: A set of over 850 free MIT-licensed high-quality SVG icons for you to use in your web projects.](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons) and [Language Icon](http://www.languageicon.org/).
